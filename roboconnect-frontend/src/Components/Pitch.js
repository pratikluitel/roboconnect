    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      The Robotics Club of Pulchowk Campus was founded in 2001 A.D. by a group
      of aspiring and visionary students of the campus with a motive of
      introducing robotics officially to the nation. With pioneering and
      reformative education introduced by the IOE, the country was fast moving
      ahead in the fields of engineering. With this and with the knowledge of
      the global scenario came the consciousness that technology is the future
      of the world. Feeling the serious necessity to keep up with the pace of
      rapidly advancing robotic development in the world added by the inception
      of Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering in the Campus, the Club was
      established. Comprised of students and alumni of the Electronics and the
      Mechanical department, the club is a haven for the young innovators of the
      campus who wish to transform their ideas to actual things and learn all
      the ways to solve the most common and subsequently, the most uncommon of
      barriers during the development course. The development process of each
      project carried out becomes the precedent for the future ones.
